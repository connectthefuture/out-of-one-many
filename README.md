Out of one, many (ex uno, plures)
=================================

Out-of-one-many (ooom) moves directories to different partitions, via a single fstab-like configuration file.

For example, with an `ooom.fstab` file containing:

<pre>
/dev/sdb1 none swap
/dev/sdc1 /home
/dev/sdd1 /usr/local ext2
/dev/sde1 /var
/dev/sdf1 /tmp
/dev/sdg1 /mnt/sdg xfs rw,noatime
</pre>

Ooom will partition, and format the new disks (`/dev/sdb`-`/dev/sdg`), and then copy the following directories:

<pre>
/home      to /dev/sdc1
/usr/local to /dev/sdd1 (formatted as ext2)
/var       to /dev/sde1
/tmp       to /dev/sdf1 (/tmp is created on /dev/sdf1, but the contents are not copied)
</pre>

Ooom will also create swapspace and mount it on `/dev/sdb1`.

Additionally, it will partition `/dev/sdg`, and format `/dev/sdg1` as `xfs`, and mount it at `/mnt/sdg` (creating the directory, if it does not exist).

Lastly, it will reboot the system, and for each directory that mounts successfully on the new partition,
it will delete the original directory, and zero the free space recovered on the partition that `/` is mounted on.
Finally, it will shutdown (power off) the system.

## Usage

To download, run:

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/rasa/out-of-one-many.git
</pre>

Alternatively, you may download ooom via:

<pre>
$ wget https://raw.github.com/rasa/out-of-one-many/master/ooom.run
$ sh ./ooom.run
</pre>

or the equivalent, but shorter:

<pre>
$ wget -O - http://goo.gl/qse72 | sh
</pre>

To install, run:

<pre>
$ cd out-of-one-many
$ vi ooom.fstab
$ vi ooom-config.sh # optional
$ sudo ./install.sh
$ sudo shutdown -r now
</pre>

Your system will reboot, and ooom will run automatically, and will shutwon (power off) the system when done.

## Limitations

Ooom does not yet allow you to move the `/boot` directory.

## Dependencies

Ooom depends on the following:

  * apt-get (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)
  * sudo access
  * Internet access (only to install packages needed by file systems)
  * parted
  * perl
  * util-linux (provides mkswap)
  * wget

Ooom will install any packages needed by a specific file system.

## Notes

Ooom works with the following filesystems:

  * btrfs
  * exfat: using PPA package ppa:relan/exfat
  * ext2
  * ext3
  * ext4
  * jfs
  * ntfs
  * swap
  * vfat
  * xfs

Ooom does not yet work with the following file systems:

* reiser4: Linux 3.8.0-26-generic is detected. Reiser4 does not support such a platform.

## Automated testing

To download and automatically run ooom, with the default `ooom.fstab, run:

<pre>
$ wget -O - http://goo.gl/9sZgS | sh
</pre>
