# If the /boot folder is not already on a separate partition,
# enabling the following line will keep the system from booting
# (you'll get a 'grub rescue' prompt, instead):
#/dev/sdb1 /boot ext2 ro 0 2
/dev/sdc1 none swap sw 0 0
/dev/sdd1 /home
# some common examples:
#/dev/sde1 /opt
#/dev/sdf1 /srv
#/dev/sdg1 /tmp
#/dev/sdh1 /usr
#/dev/sdi1 /usr/local
#/dev/sdj1 /var
#/dev/sdk1 /var/log
